\maketitle
For this problem set, I recycled the data I scraped in problem set 5. The steps I took for this task are similar to those of Problem Set 5 in which I extracted a medal count table from the Olympics in a Wikipedia entry. This table contains information about each country that has participated in either the Winter or Summer Games, and the amount of medals they won in each category (gold, silver and bronze), as well as the total medal count. 

The three visualization below show the top five countries in the medal count for the Winter and Summer Games, and the top 5 countries for the total medal count.
