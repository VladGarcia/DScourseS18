Some interesting data sources that would be interesting to scrape from would be how different politicians across the globe are interacting on twitter, or google searches varying with current events, similar to what happened after Brexit "What is the European Union" was the most searched question. 

In question 5(d), the answer is "data.frame". 

In question 6.5(b), when trying the previous command with df1 instead of df I would get an error result. I assume that was because not necessarily all commands "speak" the same language. df was specifically a Spark data frame whereas df1 was simply a data frame.
